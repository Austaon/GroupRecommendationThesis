# Installation

This project works with both Laravel and Vue, to install packages do:
`composer install` for php and `npm install` for JavaScript.

MongoDB is used as database model, thus there are no mandatory migrations. Nevertheless, there is a migration available for the session model, which can be run by running `php artisan migrate`. Finally, routes can be generated by running `php artisan route:scan`.
